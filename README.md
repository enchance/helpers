# Helper Package

A collection of methods applicable for every Laravel project. Browse through this collection of methods there might be something you just might need.

## Installation
In your `composer.json` file:

	"require": {
		"enchance/helpers": "dev-master"
	}

In `config/app.php`
	
	'providers' => [
		'Enchance\Helpers\HelpersServiceProvider',
	]

	'aliases' => [
		'Helpers' => 'Enchance\Helpers\Facade\Helpers',
	]

## Usage
Load it and have fun.

## API
I'll write some API docs once I find some time from my projects.
